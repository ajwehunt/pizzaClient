# Angular.js Pizza Builder Client

This is my submission for the Tanga coding challenge.

I decided to use Angular for this single page application with the help of Angular Material to make it presentable and fluid from a UI/UX standpoint

## Getting Started

Instructions: 
- Click the plus sign on the right to add a new pizza or topping.
- Click on a pizza to view toppings, or to add new toppings.

This application is hosted on my Digital Ocean droplet @  http://107.170.74.97:8090/

### Design

Design focused towards an intuitive and ergonomic user experience, where the user can add, edit pizzas/toppings with ease. This app is also mobile responsive.


### MVP and Next Steps

Here is the MVP outlined @ https://github.com/Tanga/pizza_server:

"Please build a client that will cover these stories, you can use any technology you feel comfortable with.
- As a builder, I should be able to list existing Pizzas
- As a builder, I should be able to create a new Pizza
- As a builder, I should be able to create toppings that can be added to a Pizza
- As a builder, I should be able to list the toppings I can to add to a Pizza
- As a builder, I should be able to add a topping to a pizza
- As a builder, I should be able to list toppings on a pizza"


I completed the MVP and added the following features:
- Pizza/Toppings list has been cleaned up by removing duplicate and nameless entries
- Pizza list is now sorted to show newest entries
- Toppings list is sorted alphabetically
- Mobile Responsive

This project was fun. From the start I wanted to create my own DB so I could have a fresh start. However by following instruction, using Tanga's Pizza Server provided me the challenge of exploring the API, and filtering out the duplicate/empty data. This was a great coding challenge and it also left me quite hungry.
